This directory contains several stacks that should be used for initialization/testing purposes. 

1. resource_roles.json
This stack describes various permissions-type resources that need to be assigned to AWS resources in order for processing to work properly.  
This includes:
IAM role for AWS SSM [required to let ssm run_command use the AWS CLI on remote ec2 instances]
+s3 access
+ec2 access
+ability to create new volumes
IAM role for AWS Lambda [required to let lambda write to and from buckets]
IAM role for EC2 [required to let ssm connect to the ec2 instance itself]

2. security_groups.json
This stack describes the security groups that we use to govern our ec2 instances. 
The dev version allows access via ssh
The deploy version does not, restricting access to ssm only. 

3. something something.yaml
This stack depends upon the 
cfn-secret-provider github repo developed by binx.io, creating custom resources that allow us to generate ssh keys. 
Please note that we explicitly DO NOT print the secret key into the global_params_initialized file as we do the identifiers to other resources. DO NOT store your keys in this repo if you intend to push your results to a remote repository. They can be used by bots to harvest bitcoin if you do so.  
To install cfn, please follow installation instructions here: 
https://github.com/binxio/cfn-secret-provider

To recover your secret key, please type:


aws ssm get-parameter --name /testkeystack/neurocaas/private-dev-key  --with-decryption 

paste the entire "value" field (minus quotes) into a file not under version control, and call the file testkeystack-custom-dev-key-pair.pem


Key generation for resources that you declare  [necessary for developer access to AMIs] via lambda custom resource.
