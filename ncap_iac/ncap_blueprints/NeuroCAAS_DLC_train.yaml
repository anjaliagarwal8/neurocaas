# Template configuration file for DeepLabCut (Mathis et al. 2018), training new networks on labeled frames.
# IMPORTANT: The inputs selected with this config file should be zip archive containing a folder of training frames, 
# as well as a .csv file (or set of csv) files containing labeled positions. 
# This folder can be generated by hand, or by running Step 1 of DLC analysis. 
# All other information (config parameters parameters) should be specified with paths in this file. 

# DeepLabCut Parameters:
# +++++++++++++++++++++
# MODE: the phase of analysis to run. 
# Used to specify whether we will be training a new network on labeled images (train)
# or to perform pose tracking on a new video with a pre-trained network (test)
# Values: "test" or "train"
mode: train

# TRAINDATA: the data that will be used to configure training of new models. 
# Provided as two paths: one to the DeepLabCut configuration file used to analyze this data, and the name of the unzipped directory as it would be named in the user's directory.
traindata:
  # CONFIGPATH: the path in S3 to the DeepLabCut 'myconfig' file specifying training specific parameters (image size, label features, etc.) 
  configpath: reviewers/inputs/myconfig.py # DLC native configuration file. 
  # TRAINPATH: the name of the unzipped directory as it would be named in the user's directory.
  trainpath: reviewers/inputs/data-reaching/ # give the name of the directory if it were to be unzipped here. Change only the basename. 

# NeuroCAAS Parameters:
# ++++++++++++++++++++
# DURATION: You can specify the duration parameter if you know how long the job will last to trigger a NeuroCAAS Save job. 
# This will cost around half of a standard job if reserved duration instances are available, and the instance will terminate once the given time limit is reached, whether or not analysis is complete.
# Units: Minutes 
# Type: INTEGER.
"__duration__": null

# DATASET SIZE: You can specify the dataset_size parameter if your dataset is large, and you know you will need extra storage space in the immutable analysis environment.
# This space will be added onto the existing size of the instance.
# Units: GB
# Type: INTEGER
"__dataset_size__": null
