1. Reviewing the website repo
    1. Please review code for features like: 
        1. Is there adequate documentation/testing overall?
        2. Is it clear how we are adding more users?
        3. Is it clear how user permissions are working?
        4. Is it clear how we are adding more analyses?
        5. Is it clear how users are being shown their data?
    2. Checking if these things seem well tested, improving test coverage.
2. Formatting and cleanup of the website. 
    1. Moving around text: Remove “what is neurocaas“ text, but move reference to our open source project to “How does neurocaas work”. 
    2. Make figure on main page bigger. 
    3. Make heading styles consistent throughout
3. Adding users/streamlining way 
    1. Try adding users and additional algorithms from the neurocaas admin page [ask taiga for admin page credentials]
    2. Consider how much user addition could be automated/integrated with the neurocaas backend
4. Development of your own algorithms. 
    1. Read the developer documentation at neurocaas/docs/ 
    2. Pick a simple feature to offer with well defined inputs and outputs. 
    3. Start playing with the development console.
    4. Feature additions: integration with docker, development of python package (non-website) api…
