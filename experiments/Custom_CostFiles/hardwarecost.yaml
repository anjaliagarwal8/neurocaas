performance: ## If you timed you own data analysis, provide info for how you did so here. If you would like to assume the same timings provided in the paper, leave this field as null (see other example file)  
  analysis_time: 1000 ## The time in seconds it took to complete analysis.  
  size: small ## Can be "small", "medium", or "large", corresponding to the three different dataset sizes that we analyzed in the paper. See paper for details on these dataset specs.
